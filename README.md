# Coppernicus_project_zwolle

#What we propose

Create an AI model (using both SensHagen and Copernicus satellite data) that provides future ongoing measurements and the capability to predict future air quality within the city of Zwolle.  

#In particular, our AI model will:

- Give insight into the spatial and temporal fluctuations of emissions

- Predict areas that are most prone to hazardous values

- Function with a sparse sensor network.
